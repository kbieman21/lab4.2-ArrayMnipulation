## Reflection Questions

# How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
push() helped me to add all the items to the array. filter() helped me to filter all items with the matching input

# What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
My challenge was not knowing the difference between filter() and find(). After I figure out the use of filter I had to do some research on how to display all the items not just one.

# How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
If I have more time I would make this project more user-friendly by clearing the filter after remove some item from the list
